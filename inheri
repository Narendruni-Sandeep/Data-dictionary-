2. Write a class 'Employee' with the following Data Members and Methods
Data Members
int empno

string job
double salary
Constructors : Write Overloaded constructors to accept the following combinations
1. All fields
2. empno & Salary
3. Empno,name & Salary
Methods/functions
void displayProfile() -Display employee details
double calMonthlyPayroll(int nod,int attend,int noh) -calculate the payroll based on the 
following criteria and return the salary per month.
No of Leaves (nol) = nod -noh -attend 
no of payroll days (nopd) = nod-nol
payroll = salary per month/30 * nopd
Write Main Method to demonstrate the usage of the object and method calls on that.
3. Bank offers various types of loans like Gold Loan, Vehicle Loan, and Mortgage Loan to customers. 
Write an abstract class to represent Loan class with the following properties and methods
Properties:

-AccountTitle
-Address
-LoanType

-NoOfInstallments
-InstallmentsPaid
-TotalToBePaid
-TotalPaid

Methods:
-PayEMI(doube amt) -to add the amount to Loan's totalPaid
-CalEMI() -to Calculate the EMI for the given principal amount, rate of interest and 
loan term.
-CalTotalToBePaid() -abstract method
4. Write 3 concrete classes for GoldLoan, VehicleLoan, MortguageLoan inheriting the Loan class by 
overriding CalTotalToBePaid() method and CalEMI(). Try to put meaningful implementation for CalEMI() 
and CalTotalToBePaid() in each of the sub class.
5. Write a class EMICalculator with a method GenerateEMI(..) with the following specification to 
calculate the EMI for the given Loan account type and other details
static void GenerateEMI(Loan ln,double prnpleamt,double rateofint,int term)
6. Write a class TotalToPayCalculator with a method CalTotalToPay(..) with the following specification to 
calculate the total amount to be paid for the given Loan account type and other details
static void CalTotalToPay(Loan ln,double prnpleamt,int term)
7. Write a class with an entry point to demonstrate the usage of EMICalcultor class method 
GenerateEMI() and TotalToPayCalculator method CalTotalToPay(..)
