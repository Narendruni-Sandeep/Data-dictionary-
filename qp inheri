Practice Questions on Inheritance and 
classes
1. Write a class 'Employee' with the following Data Members and 
Methods 
Data Members 
int empno 
string name 
string job 
double salary 
Constructors : Write Overloaded constructors to accept the following combinations 
1. All fields 
2. empno & Salary 
3. Empno,name & Salary 
Methods/functions 
void displayProfile() -Display employee details 
double calMonthlyPayroll(int nod,int attend,int noh) -calculate the payroll based on 
the following criteria and return the salary per month. 
No of Leaves (nol) = nod -noh -attend 
no of payroll days (nopd) = nod-nol 
payroll = salary per month/30 * nopd 
Write Main Method to demonstrate the usage of the object and method calls on 
that.

What is the output of the following code 
 
class IncDecOperatorEx1{ 
public static void main(String[] args){ 
int x,y,z; 
x=y=z=200; 
x=y++ + z-- + ++y; 
y=--z + x++ - z--; 
z=x-- + y-- + --x; 
System.out.println(x); 
System.out.println(y); 
System.out.println(z); 
} 
} 
 
4. Write a program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and return the 
new length of the array. 
Sample array: [20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50] 
After removing the duplicate elements the program should return 4 as the new 
length of the array. 
 
5. Create a class 'Degree' having a method 'getDegree' that prints "I got a degree". It 
has two subclasses namely 'Undergraduate' and 'Postgraduate' each having a 
method with the same name that prints "I am an Undergraduate" and "I am a 
Postgraduate" respectively. Call the method by creating an object of each of the 
three classes. 
4. Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' 
and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' 
respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an 
employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the 
same.
